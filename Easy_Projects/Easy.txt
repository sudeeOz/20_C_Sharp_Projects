Completed Beginner-Level C# Projects

As of August 15, 2025, I have successfully completed a total of 7 beginner-level C# projects. These projects were developed to strengthen my understanding of fundamental C# programming concepts, improve my algorithmic thinking, and gain practical coding experience.

Completed projects:

1.Alarm – An application that alerts the user at a specified time.

2.ATM – A simple ATM simulation that allows depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance.

3.Body Mass Index Calculator – Calculates the Body Mass Index based on the user’s height and weight.

4.Calculator – A basic calculator capable of performing four arithmetic operations.

5.Letter Counter – Counts the number of letters and characters in a given text.

6.Number Guessing Game – A game where the user guesses a randomly selected number.

7.Which Day You Were Born – Determines the day of the week for a given birth date.

Through these projects, I have gained experience in using variables, conditions, loops, methods, and basic input/output operations in C#.
